## Some background about how I build Garabatos website

At first, I built the website using HTML and CSS. 
So, to add a drawing I need to repeat the code for each drawing. 
This was annoying, and it was very easy to make mistakes. 

One day, [Nēnē](https://nene.leouieda.com/) was created, which is a static site generator. 
Now adding a new drawing is more efficient.
I just add the path and information of the drawing in a yml file.
